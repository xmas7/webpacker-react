# Webpacker::React

Webpacker-React makes it easy to use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) with [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) in your Rails applications.

This is a work in progress and moving very fast. Final features includes :

- render React components from controllers and views
- render components server-side
- use a Rails generator to create new components
- integrates with `ebpacker`, the new Rails way of doing Javascript, leveraging Webpack and Yarn

## Installation

TODO: Write installation docs once it is published

## Usage

- Add webpacker-react gem to your Gemfile
- Add react_ujs to your package.json and install it
- Use the `react_component` helper to render your component from your view !

## Development

Please feel free to open issues to discuss various ideas/needs.
